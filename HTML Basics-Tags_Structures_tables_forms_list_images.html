    <h3>Day 1 Take Away</h3>
    <p> <b>Prettier Code Formatter</b> plays a significant role in improving code quality and maintaining 
    consistency. Prettier enhances code readability, enforces consistent styling, and streamlines development workflows.
    <br><b>The Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</b> is a powerful tool that enhances the development workflow 
    by enabling real-time updates in the browser as you code. This extension is particularly useful for frontend web 
    developers who frequently need to see the changes they make in their code reflected immediately in the browser.
    <br>HTML headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags. h1 headings should be used for main headings, followed by h2 headings, 
    then the less important h3, and so on.<br>The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets- these are called HTML elements. 
    <br>Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag has an extra forward slash in 
    it.<br>Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
    Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags
</p>
<h3>Day 2 Take Away</h3>
<p> 
    <b>HTML Divisions (Div)</b>
<br>The div element is used as a container for other HTML elements. The  div element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.
The div element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common. 

<p><b>HTML PARAGRAPHS( p tag)</b></p>
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
<p>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
</p>
<div><b>HTML LINKS (a tag)</b>
<p>Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.HTML links are hyperlinks.
You can click on a link and jump to another document.
When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
Note:A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!
</p>
<p>HTML Links - Syntax</p>
The HTML a tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:a href="url">link text
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.
Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.
