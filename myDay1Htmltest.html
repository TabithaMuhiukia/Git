<!--the HTML code is in blue, and the text on screen is in black-->
<!--The HTML code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets â€” these are called HTML elements. 
Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in 
it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.-->
<!--Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags-->
<!--The terms "tag" and "element"are often used interchangeably.Strictly speaking, however, an element comprises the opening 
tag and the closing tag and any content that lies between them.Attributes provide additional information about the contents of 
an element.-->
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <p>
      This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the
      page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
      Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure
      of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or
      lower-level headings).
    </p>
    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
  </body>
</html>
<!--Everything inside the element is shown inside the main browser window. Before the <body> element you will often see a <head> element. 
This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser 
window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page). You will usually find a <title>element inside the <head>element
The contents of the <title>element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL 
of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the 
same time)-->

<!--The attribute name indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. It should be

Different attributes can have different values. <p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p: Here an attribute called lang is 
used to indicate the language used in this element. The value of this attribute on this page specifies it is in US English-->
